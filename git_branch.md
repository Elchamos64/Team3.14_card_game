## Main Branch <a id="main"></a>
### About the Branch:
The main branch is the main branch of the project. It is the branch that contains the latest stable version of the project. This branch should not be updated until it has gone through QA and tested all the features properly
## Developer Branch <a id="dev"></a>
The name of the branch is `developer_branch` you can access this branch either thorugh vs code by switching the branch you are working on the bottom left corner of your screen, or through the command line with the following command `git checkout nameOfBranch`. 

If you need to make a copy of this branch because you need to work on a feature you can use the following command `git checkout -b oscars-feature developer_branch` this will create a branch called `oscars-feature` with a copy of the all the information that is in the `developer_branch`. 
## Individual Branches <a id="ind"></a>
Branches are meant to be used for 1 feature only. So If you need to work on many features make sure you create equal amount of branches. For example, if I were working on 3 features I will create 3 branches like so:
- `feature1_branch`
- `feature2_branch`
- `feature3_branch`
